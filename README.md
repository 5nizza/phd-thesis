# Latex sources of my PhD thesis Reactive Synthesis: branching logics and paramterized systems

The sources do not represent a value perse,
but, just in case, I upload them here.

- The folder `thesis` contains the thesis. 
  I compiled it using `latexmk ./main.tex`.
  There is a compiled version `thesis/main.pdf`.

- The folder `presentation` contains the presentation.
