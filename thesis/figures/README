I use tikzit to draw diagrams.
It produces `tikz` files,
but you need the custom preamble to be able to import the tikz into that program.
The preamble is now located in file macros.tex,
see also the comments there.

My workflow is:
- edit and save the figure in tikzit (the file is included in the main.tex)
- if I updated the preamble `ctl-via-ltl`, then update macros.tex

As for odg files:
- edit them with libre
- export to PDF
- crop using pdfcrop
