\section{Introduction}
\label{gua:sec:intro}

% Motivation: (synthesis is especially valueable in concurrent settings)
Concurrent hardware and software systems are notoriously hard to get right.
Formal methods like model 
checking or synthesis can be used to guarantee correctness, but the state explosion 
problem prevents us from using such methods for systems with a large number 
of components. Furthermore, correctness properties are often expected to hold 
for an \emph{arbitrary} number of components. Both problems can be solved by 
\emph{parameterized} model checking and synthesis approaches, which give correctness 
guarantees for systems with any number of components without considering every 
possible system instance explicitly.

While parameterized model checking (PMC) is undecidable in general~\cite{Suzuki88}, 
there exists a number of methods that decide the problem for specific classes 
of systems~\cite{German92,Emerson00,Emerso03}, as well as semi-decision 
procedures that are successful in many interesting 
cases~\cite{Kurshan95,Clarke08,KaiserKW10}.
In this chapter, we consider the \emph{cutoff} method that can guarantee properties of 
systems of arbitrary size by considering only systems of up to a certain 
fixed size, thus providing a decision procedure for PMC if components are finite-state.

We consider systems that are composed of an arbitrary number of processes,
each an instance of a process template from a given, finite set.  
Process templates can be viewed as synchronization 
skeletons~\cite{EmersonC82}, i.e., program abstractions that suppress information not 
necessary for synchronization. In our system model, processes communicate by guarded updates, 
where guards are statements about other processes that are interpreted either 
conjunctively (``every other process satisfies the guard'') or disjunctively 
(``there exists a process that satisfies the guard''). Conjunctive guards can 
model atomic sections or locks, disjunctive guards can model token-passing or to some extent pairwise rendezvous (cf.~\cite{EmersonK03}). 

This class of systems has been studied by Emerson and 
Kahlon~\cite{Emerson00}, and cutoffs that depend on the 
size of process templates are known for specifications of the form 
$\forall{\bar{p}}.\ \spec(\bar{p})$, 
where $\spec(\bar{p})$ is an $\LTLmX$ property over the local states of one or more processes 
$\bar{p}$. Note that this does not allow us to specify fairness 
assumptions, for two reasons: (i) to specify fairness, additional atomic propositions for enabledness and scheduling of processes are needed, and (ii) specifications with global fairness assumptions are of the form 
$(\forall{\bar{p}}.\ \fair(\bar{p})) \impl (\forall{\bar{p}}.\ \spec(\bar{p}))$.
Because neither is supported by \cite{Emerson00}, the existing cutoffs are of 
limited use for 
reasoning about liveness properties. 

Emerson and Kahlon~\cite{Emerson00} mentioned this limitation and illustrated it
using the process template on the figure on the right.
Transitions from the initial state $N$

to the ``trying'' state $T$, and from the critical state $C$ to $N$ are always 
possible, while the transition from $T$ to $C$ is only possible if no other 
process is in $C$. The existing cutoff results can be 
used to prove safety properties like mutual exclusion for systems composed of 
arbitrarily many copies of this template. However, they cannot be used to prove 
starvation-freedom properties like 
$\forall{p}. \pforall \always (T_p \rightarrow \eventually C_p)$,
stating that every process $p$ that enters its local state $T_p$ will 
eventually enter state $C_p$, because without fairness 
of scheduling the property does not hold. 

Also, Emerson and Kahlon~\cite{Emerson00} consider only closed systems. 
Therefore, in this example, processes always try to enter $C$. 
In contrast, in open systems the transition to $T$ might be a reaction 
to a corresponding input from the environment that makes entering $C$ necessary. While it is possible to convert an open system to a closed system that is equivalent under \LTL\ properties, this comes at the cost of a blow-up.

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Motivation.} Our work is inspired by applications in
parameterized synthesis~\cite{JB14}, where the goal is to automatically
construct process templates such that a given specification is satisfied in
systems with an arbitrary number of components.
In this setting,
one generally considers \emph{open systems} that interact with an uncontrollable environment (user).
Also, most specifications contain liveness properties that cannot be guaranteed without fairness assumptions.
Note that in the parameterized setting liveness properties cannot be reduced to safety properties,
because the size of a system is not bounded a priori.
Finally, we are interested in synthesizing deadlock-free systems.
\emph{Cutoffs} are essential for parameterized synthesis,
because they enable a semi-decision procedure to parameterized synthesis.

{\bf Contributions.}
\begin{itemize}
\item We show that existing cutoffs for model checking of $\LTLmX$ properties are in general not sufficient for systems with \emph{fairness assumptions}, and provide new cutoffs for this case.
\item We improve some of the existing cutoff results, and give separate cutoffs for the problem of \emph{deadlock detection}, which is closely related to fairness. 
\item We prove \emph{tightness} or asymptotical tightness for all of our cutoffs, showing that smaller cutoffs cannot exist with respect to the parameters we consider.
\end{itemize}
%
Moreover, all of our cutoffs directly support \emph{open systems}, where each process may communicate with an adversarial environment. This makes the blow-up incurred by translation to an equivalent closed system unnecessary. 
Finally,
we will show in Sect.~\ref{gua:sec:paramsynt}
how to integrate our size-dependent cutoffs into the parameterized synthesis approach.
%The results presented here are based on a more detailed preliminary version of this paper~\cite{AJK15}.
